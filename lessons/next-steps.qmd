We have covered various ways to do basic analyze iNaturalist data.

Next step is for you to come up with some questions, and analyze the CNC iNaturalist data.

We covered a lot of information, so review the lessons notes, scripts, and videos.

Create a script file to save your work.

Come up with some questions that you are interested in. Copy and paste examples provided in the lessons, and adjust them to fit your needs. When you have something that kinda works, save the script file and the results.

Data exploration is an iterative process. Try lots of different way to look at the data. Use `filter()`, `select()`, `count()`, and `mutate()` to change the data. Then create summary tables, charts, and/or maps to find patterns. Repeat the process. You can create multiple script files.

Add comments to the code to remind yourself what the code does.

As you are analyzing the data, think about how you want to present your results.

Attend the office hours or email me if you have questions.
