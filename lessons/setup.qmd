This workshop use GitHub to host and run the code, data, software, and infrastructure needed for the workshop. Attendees will not need to install stuff on their own computer; everything is available online using GitHub.

If you are interested in installing all the software, data, and code on your computer, visit the [Setup - local page](setup-local.qmd)

## Initial Setup

It will take about ten minutes to set things up on Github.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform that lets people store, manage, and share their code. Github uses version control software called [Git](https://git-scm.com/) that keeps track of changes for all files inside a folder. We call a folder that uses Git to track changes a repository.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provide an online development environment where people can run their code without installing stuff on their computer.

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) is a tool that teachers can use to share, manage, and grade assignments.

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is software to write and run R code.

### If you don't have a Github account, create an account.

1.  Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
2.  After you login, update your settings.
3.  Go to [Emails settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
    1.  Select 'Keep my email addresses private'. 'Block command line pushes that expose my email' should also be automatically selected.
4.  Optional. Go to [Password and authentication settings](https://github.com/settings/security).
    1.  If needed, setup Passkey or two-factor authentication.

### Setup Github Classroom and Codespaces

To access the files needed for the workshop, join the After iNaturalist Github Classroom.

1.  Click on the invitation link for After iNaturalist classroom that we emailed to you.

2.  You will see a "Accept the assignment" page. Click "Accept this assignment" button.

       
This will create a repository in GitHub with code and data for the workshop. The repository will be created in [`{r} classroom_organization`](`{r} classroom_repos`) Github account. You will save your work to this repository. Only you and the workshop organizers can access your repository.

3.  You will see a "You're ready to go!" page. Copy the link for your repository and save it somewhere on your computer. This is how you will access your repository on subsequent visits. Click "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button.

    This will set up an online development environment where you can write and run code.

4.  You will see page with "Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..." message in the corner. The software for the workshop is being downloaded and installed. This will take about 5 minutes.

You are done setting up Github. If you have problems, please email us.

## Accessing your files

After the initial setup of Codespaces, there are two ways to access the files in your repository.

1.  To access your repository, use the link provided in the step 3 from 'Initial Setup'.

Or

1.  Go to [`{r} classroom_organization`](`{r} classroom_repos`) Github page, and you should see your repository. Click on your repository.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button. This will restart the Codespace created in the "Setup Github Classroom and Codespaces" section.
