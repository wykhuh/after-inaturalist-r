This workshop use GitHub to host and run the code, data, software, and infrastructure needed for the workshop. Attendees will not need to install stuff on their own computer; everything is available online using GitHub.

If you are interested in install all the software, data, and code on your computer, visit the [Setup - local page](setup-local.qmd)

## Intitial Setup

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform that lets people store, manage, and share their code.

Repository is folder that has code, data, etc for a coding project. The repository also uses software called [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep track of file changes.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provide an online development environment where people can run their code without installing stuff on their computer.

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) is a tool that teachers can use to share, manage, and grade coding assignments.

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is software to write and run R code.

### If you don't have a Github account, create an account.

1.  Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
