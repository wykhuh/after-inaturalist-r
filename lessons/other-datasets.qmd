Load packages

```{r,load_packages}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(readr) # read and write tabular data

There is a bug with **sf** <https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1762>. This bit of code is fix for the bug.

```{r fix_sf_bug_1}
sf_use_s2(FALSE)
```

## Other datasets

There are various geospatial datasets that are free to use. Data sources used for this course include [LA City Geohub](https://geohub.lacity.org), [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov), [California State Parks](https://www.parks.ca.gov), [County of Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacounty.gov), and [US Census TIGER](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/tiger-data-products-guide.html).

We've pre-selected some geospatial data that workshop attendees might want to use to analyze iNaturalist data and provided a preview in the code below. These files are in the `data/raw` directory. We modified some of the downloaded data to make things easier for workshop attendees; see [Editing geospatial files](editing-geo-files.qmd) for more details. These files are in the `data/cleaned` directory.

When you use data from other sources, it's a good idea to tell people where you got the data. Some data sets require people to cite the original source. Plus, it helps people who are looking at your analysis to know where you got the data.

## LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data within different LA city neighborhoods.

LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::neighborhood-council-boundaries-2018/about>

```{r get_neighborhood_council}
nc_boundaries <- read_sf(here('data/raw/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified)/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified).shp'))
```

Use `View()` to see all the records.

```{r view_neighborhood_council}
#| eval: false
View(nc_boundaries)
```

```{r map_neighborhood_council}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=nc_boundaries) +
  theme_minimal()
```

If we want the boundaries for one neighborhood, we can use `filter()`. Let's get the boundaries for Arroyo Seco neighborhood council. We have to use capital letters because that's the format of the original data.

```{r get_arroyo_seco}
arroyo_seco <- nc_boundaries %>%
  filter(NAME == 'ARROYO SECO NC')
```

```{r map_arroy_seco}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=arroyo_seco) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can save the boundaries for Arroyo Seco NC using `st_write()`. First argument is the sf object, the second argument is the path. We can save the file as a Shapefile using `.shp` extension, or as GeoJSON file using `.geojson` extension.

```{r save_arroyo_seco}
#| eval: false
st_write(arroyo_seco, here('data/cleaned/arroyo_seco_boundaries.geojson'))
```

## Los Angeles Times - LA neighborhoods

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with different neighborhoods in LA county.

Los Angeles Times Data Desk developed a map that broke down L.A. County in 272 neighborhoods. <https://maps.latimes.com/about/index.html>

```{r get_la_times_neigbhorhoods}
la_neighborhoods <- read_sf(here('data/raw/la_times_la_county_neighborhoods.json'))
```

```{r map_la_times_neigbhorhoods}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_neighborhoods) 
```

## LA County incorporated and unincorporated boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

City and Unincorporated Community Boundary (LA County Planning) <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::city-and-unincorporated-community-boundary-la-county-planning/about> This layer shows all incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County

```{r get_admin_boundaries}
admin_boundaries <- read_sf(here('data/raw/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY_-2349953032962506288/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY.shp'))
```

```{r map_admin_boundaries}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=admin_boundaries)
```

## Parks in LA County

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with the location of parks.

National Park Boundaries: <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-park-boundaries>

California State Parks: <https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=29682>

County of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::dpr-park-facilities-view-accessible-parks/explore>

City of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::los-angeles-recreation-and-parks-boundaries/about>

Load all the parks data.

```{r, get_parks_data}
parks_national <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/nps_la_county.geojson'))

parks_state <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/state_parks_los_angeles_county/state_parks_los_angeles_county.shp'))

parks_county <- read_sf(here('data/raw/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks)/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks).shp'))

parks_city <- read_sf(here('data/raw/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries.shp'))
```

We want to convert the CRS of the parks data be the same

```{r, update_county_crs}
parks_county <- st_transform(parks_county, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_city_crs}
parks_city <- st_transform(parks_city, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_state_crs}
parks_state <- st_transform(parks_state, crs = st_crs(parks_national))

```

Create map with parks and iNaturalist data. Use `col.region` to set the color of the parks.

```{r, map_of_parks}
#| eval: false

mapview(parks_national, col.region='orange') + 
  mapview(parks_county, col.region='red') + 
  mapview(parks_city, col.region='yellow') +
  mapview(parks_state, col.region='green') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_parks.png){fig-alt="map of parks"}

## LA County water areas

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with streams, rivers, lakes, ponds in LA County.

We got water areas using US Census TIGER/Line data.

```{r get_water_areas}
water_areas <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/la_county_waterareas.geojson'))
```

```{r map_water_areas}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=water_areas)
```

We also have a file for the LA River.

```{r get_la_river}
la_river <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/los_angeles_river.geojson'))
```

```{r map_la_river}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_river)
```

## Wildfires in LA County

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with wildfires.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) keeps track wildfires in California. [CAL FIRE website](https://www.fire.ca.gov), [CAL FIRE datasets](https://data.ca.gov/organization/cal-fire).

[California Fire Perimeters (all)](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-fire-perimeters-all): This dataset covers California wildfires from 1878 to 2023. "Although the dataset represents the most complete digital record of fire perimeters in California, it is still incomplete, and users should be cautious when drawing conclusions based on the data."

[CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) Data](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/cal-fire-damage-inspection-dins-data): "This database represents structures impacted by wildland fire that are inside or within 100 meters of the fire perimeter." This dataset covers 2013 to 2025.

[CA Perimeters NIFC FIRIS public view](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-perimeters-nifc-firis-public-view): "This public layer was created to be used by the CAL FIRE Communications Program for the CAL FIRE incident map." This dataset covers 2024 to 2025.

The Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Group keeps track of wildfires in the United States.

[WFIGS 2025 Interagency Fire Perimeters to Date](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wfigs-2025-interagency-fire-perimeters-to-date/about): "Best available perimeters for all reported wildland fires in the United States in the current year to date". This dataset covers 2025.

We downloaded the datasets and extracted data for the wildfires in Los Angeles County.

```{r get_la_county_boundary}
la_county <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/los_angeles_county/los_angeles_county.shp'))
```

### California Fire Perimeters (all) for LA county

Wildfires in LA County from 1878 to 2023.

```{r get_all_la_county_fires}
fires_all_la <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/cal_fire_los_angeles_county.geojson'))

dim(fires_all_la)
```

2619 wildfires

Let's get wildfires in the last ten years.

This dataset has a `YEAR` column. We can `filter()` by `YEAR`

```{r get_fires_for_10_year}
decade_fires <- fires_all_la %>%
  filter(YEAR_ >= 2015)

dim(decade_fires)
```

264 wildfires

```{r create_map_for_fires_for_10_years}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_county) +
  geom_sf(data=decade_fires, fill='yellow')
```

Let's get all wildfires for a particular location.

We can use `st_point()` to create a point using longitude and latitude. Then use `st_sfc()` to add geometry and CRS.

```{r create_location}
point <- st_point(c(-118.809407, 34.089205))
location <- st_sfc(point, crs=st_crs(4326))

location
```

```{r map_location}
#| eval: false
mapview(location) 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/location_point.png)

check if CRS are the same

```{r check_crs_location_fire}
st_crs(location) == st_crs(fires_all_la)
```

Set CRS of the fires_all_la to match the location.

```{r update_crs_location_fire}
fires_all_la <- st_transform(fires_all_la, crs=4326)

st_crs(location) == st_crs(fires_all_la)
```

Find the fires that intersect with the location.

```{r find_fires_for_location}

fires_for_location <- fires_all_la[lengths(st_intersects(fires_all_la, location)) > 0,]

fires_for_location
```

```{r creat}
#| eval: false
mapview(fires_for_location, zcol="FIRE_NAME") +
  mapview(location) 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/fire_for_location.png)

### CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) for LA county

Structures in LA County impacted by wildfires from 2013 to 2025.

```{r get_damaged_structures}
DINS_la <-read_sf(here('data/cleaned/DINS_los_angeles_county.geojson'))

dim(DINS_la)
```

34, 266 structures were damaged in wildfire.

Let's get the damaged structures for 2025.

```{r get_damaged_structures_2025}
recent_DINS <- DINS_la %>% 
  mutate(year = year(INCIDENTST)) %>%
  filter(year == 2025)

dim(recent_DINS)
```

30,493 structures were damaged in 2025.

```{r create_map_for_damaged_structures_2025}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_county) +
  geom_sf(data=recent_DINS)
```

### CA Perimeters NIFC FIRIS for LA county

Wildfires in LA County from 2024 to 2025.

```{r create_map_for_nifc_firis}
NIFC_FIRIS_la <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/NIFC_FIRIS_los_angeles_county.geojson'))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_county) +
  geom_sf(data=NIFC_FIRIS_la, fill='yellow')
```

### WFIGS 2025 Interagency Fire Perimeters to Date for LA county

Wildfires in LA County in 2025.

```{r create_map_for_2025_fires}
WFIGS_2025_la <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/wfigs_2025_los_angeles_county.geojson'))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_county) +
  geom_sf(data=WFIGS_2025_la, fill='yellow')
```

## Demographics data

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with demographics data about people in LA County.

L.A. County completed Comprehensive Countywide Park Needs Assessment in 2016. As part of that study, they looked at demographics data throughout the county. For more information: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::l-a-county-park-needs-assessment-demographics/about>

::: callout-note
A lot of demographics data from the Park Needs Assessment comes from the U.S. Census. The reason we're using the parks data instead directly using Census data is because the Census data is more difficult to use. If you want to learn how to use U.S. Census data in R, check out the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html)
:::

We load Park Needs Assessment data using `read_sf()` to read GeoJSON file. Click `la_county_pna` in the Environment pane to browse the data frame.

```{r, get_pna_data}
la_county_pna <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/LA_County_PNA_Demographics.geojson'))
```

### Household Median Income

Let's look at the Household Median Income. We can use `zcol` to choose which column view to in the map. The field 'householdincome_medhinc_cy' refers to Household Median Income.

```{r, map_of_median_income}
#| eval: false
mapview(la_county_pna, 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy')
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_median_income.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income"}

There are two issues with the previous map.

1.  The name of the layer is too long. We can rename the layer using `layer.name ='New Name'.` `layer.name ='Avg income'` sets the layer name to 'Avg income'.

2.  When you click on region, the popup shows too many fields. Use `select()` to pick the columns you need, and assign the results to a new object.

```{r, fix_map}
#| eval: false

la_county_pna_map <- la_county_pna %>%
  select(STUD_AR_NM, householdincome_medhinc_cy)

mapview(la_county_pna_map, 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy',
        layer.name ='Avg income') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/fix_map.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income with fixed layer name and popups"}

## LA County Environmental Justice Screening Method

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with environmental factors.

The Environmental Justice Screening Method (EJSM) was developed for Los Angeles County by USC PERE / Occidental College for LA County's Green Zones Program. This tool can be used to identify stationary sources of pollution and analyze cumulative environmental impacts. The overall score show the pollution impacts for each census tract. <https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::ejsm-scores/about>

```{r get_ejsm}
ejsm <- read_sf(here('data/raw/EJSM_Scores-shp/6cbc6914-690f-48ec-a54f-2649a8ddb321202041-1-139ir98.m1ys.shp'))
```

```{r select_ejsm_fields}
ejsm_edit <- ejsm %>% 
  select(CIscore, HazScore, HealthScor, SVscore, CCVscore)
```

There are 5 fields in the data set.

|            |                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| CIscore    | Cumulative Impact Score            |
| HazScore   | Hazard Proximity Score             |
| HealthScor | Health Score                       |
| SVscore    | Social Vulnerability Score         |
| CCVscore   | Climate Change Vulnerability Score |

```{r map_ejsm}
#| eval: false
mapview(ejsm_edit, zcol='CIscore',
        layer.name='Cumulative Impact') 
```

## Los Angeles Ecotopes

LA Sanitation and Environment (LASAN) oversees the City of Los Angeles [biodiversity initiative](http://lacitysan.org/biodiversity). LASAN published [2020 Biodiversity Report](https://sanitation.lacity.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/y250/mduy/~edisp/cnt052553.pdf) that outlines how to measure the health of the urban ecosystem in Los Angeles. As part of that report, they identified 17 ecological regions in LA called ecotopes. "Ecotopes are also envisioned as future management units to address biodiversity and related urban ecosystem stewardship topics of ecosystem services, pollution, and ecological hazards."

```{r get_ecotopes}
ecotopes <- read_sf(here('data/raw/LA_Area_Ecotopes/FINAL Ecotope_Boundaries.shp'))

names(ecotopes)
```

```{r map_ecotopes}
#| eval: false

mapview(ecotopes, zcol='ET_LndsZon')
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/ecotopes.png){fig-alt="create map with ecotopes"}

## LA city Indicator Species

LASAN worked with the Biodiversity Expert Council to create a list of [37 biodiversity indicator species](https://sanitation.lacity.gov/san/faces/wcnav_externalId/s-lsh-es-si-bd-par?_adf.ctrl-state=61c3l34pj_78&_afrLoop=10147855306996952#!). When the species are present, it means the area has high quality habitat that can support biodiversity

Let's create a map of showing the observations of indicator species.

Get all iNaturalist observations

```{r get_inaturalist_data}
#| message: false
inat_data <- read_csv(here('data/cleaned/cnc-los-angeles-observations.csv'))
```

Use `st_as_sf()` to add a geometry column so we can map the observations.

```{r add_geometry_to_inaturalist}
inat_sf <- st_as_sf(inat_data, 
                         coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),   crs = 4326)
```

Get list of indicator species.

```{r get_indicator_species}
#| message: false
indicator_species <- read_csv(here('data/cleaned/LA_city_indicator_species.csv'))
```

Get the column names for `indicator_species`.

```{r get_indicator_species_columns}
names(indicator_species)
```

Get the scientific names for all the indicator species.

```{r get_scientific_names}
indicator_scientific_names <- indicator_species$'scientific name'

indicator_scientific_names
```

Find observations for indicator species by looking for `scientific_name` that are in the `indicator_scientific_names`.

```{r get_indicator_species_observations}
indicator_sf <- inat_sf %>%
  filter(scientific_name %in% indicator_scientific_names) %>%
  select(scientific_name, common_name)

dim(indicator_sf)
```

```{r map_indicator_species}
#| eval: false

mapview(indicator_sf)
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/indicator_species.png){fig-alt="create map with indicator species"}

## Calscape

Some people might be interested in observations for native plants.

[Calscape](https://www.calscape.org) is project by the California Native Plant Society that helps people find native plants in their area. We downloaded a list of native plants for [Los Angeles County](https://www.calscape.org/search?height_from=&height_to=&lat=34.3871821&lng=-118.1122679&location_name=Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20CA%2C%20USA).

Get all iNaturalist observations

```{r get_inaturalist_data_2}
#| message: false
inat_data <- read_csv(here('data/cleaned/cnc-los-angeles-observations.csv'))
```

Use `st_as_sf()` to add a geometry column so we can map the observations.

```{r add_geometry_to_inaturalist_2}
inat_sf <- st_as_sf(inat_data, 
                         coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),   crs = 4326)

```

Get list of native plants.

```{r get_native_plants_datas}
calscape_la_county <- read_csv(here("data/raw/calscape - Los Angeles County, CA.csv"))

names(calscape_la_county)
```

Get columns.

```{r get_calscape_columns}
names(calscape_la_county)
```

Get the scientific names for all the native plants.

```{r get_plants_scientific_names}
