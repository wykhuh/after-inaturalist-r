## Other datasets

There are various geospatial datasets that you can use while analyzing iNaturalist data. Some datasets are free to use, some require crediting the original data source.

We got data from [LA City Geohub](https://geohub.lacity.org), [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov), [California State Parks](https://www.parks.ca.gov), and [County of Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacounty.gov).

We've provided a variety of geospatial data that workshop attendees can use for their analysis. Some the data we directly downloaded from other sources. Some of the data we downloaded from other sources and then modified. See [Editing geospatial files](editing-geo-files.qmd) to see the code we used to modified the files.

## Demographics data

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with demographics data about people in LA County.

L.A. County completed Comprehensive Countywide Park Needs Assessment in 2016. As part of that study, they looked at demographics data throughout the county. For more information: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::l-a-county-park-needs-assessment-demographics/about>

::: callout-note
A lot of demographics data from the Park Needs Assessment comes from the U.S. Census. The reason we're using the parks data instead directly using Census data is because the Census data is more difficult to use. If you want to learn how to use U.S. Census data in R, check out the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html)
:::

We load Park Needs Assessment data using `read_sf()` to read GeoJSON file. Click `la_county_pna` in the Environment pane to browse the data frame.

```{r, get_pna_data}
la_county_pna <- read_sf('data/raw/PNA_Demographics_for_Dashboard_(View_Layer_SDE)_8662424390864523907.geojson')
```

The last row has data for the entire LA County. Let's remove that last row.

```{r, remove_row_for_entire_county}
la_county_pna <- la_county_pna[-c(189), ]

dim(la_county_pna)
```

There are 96 fields in the data set. Here's a short description of the fields.

### Household Median Income

Let's look at the Household Median Income. We can use `zcol` to choose which column view to in the map. The field 'householdincome_medhinc_cy' refers to Household Median Income.

```{r, map_of_median_income}
#| eval: false
mapview(la_county_pna, 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy')
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_median_income.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income"}

There are two issues with the previous map.

1.  The name of the layer is too long. We can rename the layer using `layer.name ='New Name'`

2.  When you click on region, the popup shows too many fields. To select the columns displayed in popups, we can set the columns using `dataframe[c('col_1', 'col_2')]`.

`layer.name ='Avg income'` sets the layer name to 'Avg income'.

`la_county_pna[c('STUD_AR_NM', 'householdincome_medhinc_cy')]` sets the columns show in the popup to householdincome_medhinc_cy and STUD_AR_NM

```{r, fix_map}
#| eval: false
mapview(la_county_pna[c('STUD_AR_NM', 'householdincome_medhinc_cy')], 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy',
        layer.name ='Avg income') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/fix_map.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income with fixed layer name and popups"}

## Parks in LA County

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with the location of parks.

National Park Boundaries: <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-park-boundaries>

California State Parks: <https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=29682>

County of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::dpr-park-facilities-view-accessible-parks/explore>

City of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::los-angeles-recreation-and-parks-boundaries/about>

Load all the parks data.

```{r, get_parks_data}
parks_national <- read_sf('data/cleaned/nps_la_county.geojson')

parks_state <- read_sf('data/cleaned/state_parks_los_angeles_county/state_parks_los_angeles_county.shp')

parks_county <- read_sf('data/raw/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks)/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks).shp')

parks_city <- read_sf('data/raw/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries.shp')
```

We want to convert the CRS of the parks data be the same

```{r, update_county_crs}
parks_county <- st_transform(parks_county, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_city_crs}
parks_city <- st_transform(parks_city, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_city_crs_2}
parks_state <- st_transform(parks_state, crs = st_crs(parks_national))

```

Create map with parks and iNaturalist data. Use `col.region` to set the color of the parks.

```{r, map_of_parks}
#| eval: false

mapview(parks_national, col.region='orange') + 
  mapview(parks_county, col.region='red') + 
  mapview(parks_city, col.region='yellow') +
  mapview(parks_state, col.region='green') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_parks.png){fig-alt="map of parks"}

## LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data within different LA city neighborhoods.

LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::neighborhood-council-boundaries-2018/about>

```{r}
nc_boundaries <- read_sf('data/raw/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified)/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified).shp')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=nc_boundaries) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Los Angeles Times - LA neighborhoods

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with different neighborhoods in LA county.

Los Angeles Times Data Desk developed a map that broke down L.A. County in 272 neighborhoods. <https://maps.latimes.com/about/index.html>

```{r read_neighborhood_file}
la_neighborhoods <- read_sf('data/raw/la_times_la_county_neighborhoods.json')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_neighborhoods) 
```

## LA County incorporated and unincorporated boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

City and Unincorporated Community Boundary (LA County Planning) <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::city-and-unincorporated-community-boundary-la-county-planning/about> This layer shows all incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County

```{r}
admin_boundaries <- read_sf('data/raw/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY_-2349953032962506288/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY.shp')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=admin_boundaries)
```

## LA County Environmental Justice Screening Method

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with environmental factors.

The Environmental Justice Screening Method (EJSM) was developed for Los Angeles County by USC PERE / Occidental College for LA County's Green Zones Program. This tool can be used to identify stationary sources of pollution and analyze cumulative environmental impacts. The overall score show the pollution impacts for each census tract. <https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::ejsm-scores/about>

```{r}
ejsm <- read_sf('data/raw/EJSM_Scores-shp/6cbc6914-690f-48ec-a54f-2649a8ddb321202041-1-139ir98.m1ys.shp')
```

```{r}
ejsm_edit <- ejsm %>% 
  select(CIscore, HazScore, HealthScor, SVscore, CCVscore)
```

There are 5 fields in the data set.

|            |                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| CIscore    | Cumulative Impact Score            |
| HazScore   | Hazard Proximity Score             |
| HealthScor | Health Score                       |
| SVscore    | Social Vulnerability Score         |
| CCVscore   | Climate Change Vulnerability Score |

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(ejsm_edit, zcol='CIscore',
        layer.name='Cumulative Impact') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/ejsm.png){fig-alt="create map with ejsm"}

## LA County water areas

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with streams, rivers, lakes, ponds in LA County.

US Census TIGER/Line data provides information about water areas.

```{r}
water_areas <- read_sf('data/cleaned/la_county_waterareas.geojson')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=water_areas)
```

We also have a file for the LA River.

```{r}
la_river <- read_sf('data/cleaned/los_angeles_river.geojson')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_river)
```
