## Other datasets

There are various geospatial datasets that are free to use. Some datasets require crediting the original data source. Data sources used for this course include [LA City Geohub](https://geohub.lacity.org), [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov), [California State Parks](https://www.parks.ca.gov), [County of Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacounty.gov), and [US Census TIGER](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/tiger-data-products-guide.html).

We've pre-selected some geospatial data that workshop attendees might want to use to analyze iNaturalist data and provided a preview in the code below. These files are in the `data` directory. We modified some of the downloaded data to make things easier for workshop attendees; see [Editing geospatial files](editing-geo-files.qmd) for more details.

## Demographics data

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with demographics data about people in LA County.

L.A. County completed Comprehensive Countywide Park Needs Assessment in 2016. As part of that study, they looked at demographics data throughout the county. For more information: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::l-a-county-park-needs-assessment-demographics/about>

::: callout-note
A lot of demographics data from the Park Needs Assessment comes from the U.S. Census. The reason we're using the parks data instead directly using Census data is because the Census data is more difficult to use. If you want to learn how to use U.S. Census data in R, check out the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html)
:::

We load Park Needs Assessment data using `read_sf()` to read GeoJSON file. Click `la_county_pna` in the Environment pane to browse the data frame.

```{r, get_pna_data}
la_county_pna <- read_sf('data/cleaned/LA_County_PNA_Demographics.geojson')
```

### Household Median Income

Let's look at the Household Median Income. We can use `zcol` to choose which column view to in the map. The field 'householdincome_medhinc_cy' refers to Household Median Income.

```{r, map_of_median_income}
#| eval: false
mapview(la_county_pna, 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy')
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_median_income.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income"}

There are two issues with the previous map.

1.  The name of the layer is too long. We can rename the layer using `layer.name ='New Name'`

2.  When you click on region, the popup shows too many fields. Use `select()` to pick the columns you need, and assign the new data frame to a new object.

`layer.name ='Avg income'` sets the layer name to 'Avg income'

```{r, fix_map}
#| eval: false

la_county_pna_map <- la_county_pna %>%
  select(STUD_AR_NM, householdincome_medhinc_cy)

mapview(la_county_pna_map, 
        zcol='householdincome_medhinc_cy',
        layer.name ='Avg income') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/fix_map.png){fig-alt="interactive map of Household Median Income with fixed layer name and popups"}

## Parks in LA County

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with the location of parks.

National Park Boundaries: <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-park-boundaries>

California State Parks: <https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=29682>

County of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::dpr-park-facilities-view-accessible-parks/explore>

City of Los Angeles parks: <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::los-angeles-recreation-and-parks-boundaries/about>

Load all the parks data.

```{r, get_parks_data}
parks_national <- read_sf('data/cleaned/nps_la_county.geojson')

parks_state <- read_sf('data/cleaned/state_parks_los_angeles_county/state_parks_los_angeles_county.shp')

parks_county <- read_sf('data/raw/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks)/DPR_Park_Facilities_View_(Accessible_Parks).shp')

parks_city <- read_sf('data/raw/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries/Los_Angeles_Recreation_and_Parks_Boundaries.shp')
```

We want to convert the CRS of the parks data be the same

```{r, update_county_crs}
parks_county <- st_transform(parks_county, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_city_crs}
parks_city <- st_transform(parks_city, crs = st_crs(parks_national))
```

```{r, update_city_crs_2}
parks_state <- st_transform(parks_state, crs = st_crs(parks_national))

```

Create map with parks and iNaturalist data. Use `col.region` to set the color of the parks.

```{r, map_of_parks}
#| eval: false

mapview(parks_national, col.region='orange') + 
  mapview(parks_county, col.region='red') + 
  mapview(parks_city, col.region='yellow') +
  mapview(parks_state, col.region='green') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/map_of_parks.png){fig-alt="map of parks"}

## LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data within different LA city neighborhoods.

LA City Neighborhood Councils boundaries <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::neighborhood-council-boundaries-2018/about>

```{r}
nc_boundaries <- read_sf('data/raw/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified)/Neighborhood_Councils_(Certified).shp')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=nc_boundaries) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Los Angeles Times - LA neighborhoods

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with different neighborhoods in LA county.

Los Angeles Times Data Desk developed a map that broke down L.A. County in 272 neighborhoods. <https://maps.latimes.com/about/index.html>

```{r read_neighborhood_file}
la_neighborhoods <- read_sf('data/raw/la_times_la_county_neighborhoods.json')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_neighborhoods) 
```

## LA County incorporated and unincorporated boundaries

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

City and Unincorporated Community Boundary (LA County Planning) <https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::city-and-unincorporated-community-boundary-la-county-planning/about> This layer shows all incorporated and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County

```{r}
admin_boundaries <- read_sf('data/raw/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY_-2349953032962506288/admin_dist_SDE_DIST_DRP_CITY_COMM_BDY.shp')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=admin_boundaries)
```

## LA County Environmental Justice Screening Method

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with environmental factors.

The Environmental Justice Screening Method (EJSM) was developed for Los Angeles County by USC PERE / Occidental College for LA County's Green Zones Program. This tool can be used to identify stationary sources of pollution and analyze cumulative environmental impacts. The overall score show the pollution impacts for each census tract. <https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::ejsm-scores/about>

```{r}
ejsm <- read_sf('data/raw/EJSM_Scores-shp/6cbc6914-690f-48ec-a54f-2649a8ddb321202041-1-139ir98.m1ys.shp')
```

```{r}
ejsm_edit <- ejsm %>% 
  select(CIscore, HazScore, HealthScor, SVscore, CCVscore)
```

There are 5 fields in the data set.

|            |                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| CIscore    | Cumulative Impact Score            |
| HazScore   | Hazard Proximity Score             |
| HealthScor | Health Score                       |
| SVscore    | Social Vulnerability Score         |
| CCVscore   | Climate Change Vulnerability Score |

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(ejsm_edit, zcol='CIscore',
        layer.name='Cumulative Impact') 
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/ejsm.png){fig-alt="create map with ejsm"}

## LA County water areas

Some people might be interested in comparing iNaturalist data with streams, rivers, lakes, ponds in LA County.

US Census TIGER/Line data provides information about water areas.

```{r}
water_areas <- read_sf('data/cleaned/la_county_waterareas.geojson')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=water_areas)
```

We also have a file for the LA River.

```{r}
la_river <- read_sf('data/cleaned/los_angeles_river.geojson')
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=la_river)
```

## Los Angeles Ecotopes

LA Sanitation and Environment published [2020 Biodiversity Report](https://sanitation.lacity.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/y250/mduy/~edisp/cnt052553.pdf) that outlines how to measure the health of the urban ecosystem in Los Angeles. As part of that report, they identified 17 ecological regions in LA called ecotopes. "Ecotopes are also envisioned as future management units to address biodiversity and related urban ecosystem stewardship topics of ecosystem services, pollution, and ecological hazards."

```{r}
ecotopes <- read_sf('data/raw/LA_Area_Ecotopes/FINAL Ecotope_Boundaries.shp')

names(ecotopes)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

mapview(ecotopes, zcol='ET_LndsZon')
```

![](images/mapview/other-datasets/ecotopes.png){fig-alt="create map with ecotopes"}
