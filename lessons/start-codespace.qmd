title: "Start Codespace"
---

Currently, every free Github account has access to 120 core hours per month to run Codespaces. When you start a Codespace, by default it uses 2 cores. This means you can run a Codespace for 60 hours per month (120 core hours / 2 cores = 60 hours). For more information, visit [Codespaces Billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).

1.  Go to your Github repository.

2.  Click the "Code" green button. Click the "Codespaces" tab.

4.  You will be redirected to the new Codespace in a new browser tab. This is Visual Studio Code, the default code editor for GitHub Codespace. We want to use RStudio as our code editor.

    You will see page with "Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..." message in the corner. The software for the workshop is being downloaded and installed. This will take about 5 minutes.

5.  Once the Codespace has started, there should be a "bash", "Codespaces: timer", and "Codespaces: rstudio-start" on the lower right. Click on the "PORTS" tab at the bottom.
