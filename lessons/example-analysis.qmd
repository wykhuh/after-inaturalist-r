```

This lesson shows how to I used some of the code samples in the previous lessons to create an analysis that has maps and charts.

My question: I want to get all research grade observations for Great Blue Heron in LA County near bodies of water.

## Restart Codespace

First step is to start Codespace.

1.  Go to [`{r} classroom_organization`](`{r} classroom_repos`) Github page, and you should see your repository. Click on your repository.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button. This will restart the Codespace created in the "Setup Github Classroom and Codespaces" section.

    ![](images/setup/repo-open-codespace.png)

3.  This is Visual Studio Code, the default code editor for GitHub Codespaces. We want to use RStudio as our code editor.

    ![](images/setup/building-codespace.png)

4.  Once the Codespace has started, it will run a script for timer, and start RStudio. In the lower right, there should be a "bash", "Codespaces: timer", and "Codespaces: rstudio-start".

    Click on the "PORTS" tab at the bottom.

    ![](images/setup/finish-building.png)

5.  In the PORTS tab, hover over the item named RStudio or 8787. Click on the middle globe icon to start RStudio in a new browser tab.

![](images/setup/rstudio-port.png)

6.  Now you are ready to write and run R code using RStudio.

    Even though we won't use Visual Studio Code to write R code, keep the tab for Visual Studio Code open.

    ![](images/setup/rstudio.png)

## Creating script

To start the analysis, I create a file called 'heron-analysis.R', and save it in the 'scripts' folder.

First step is load the R packages. These R packages provide functions that we need to analyze the City Nature Challenge data.

```{r load_packages}
#| message: false
library(readr) # read and write tabular data
library(dplyr) # manipulate tabular data
library(lubridate) # manipulate dates
library(here) # file paths
library(stringr) # manipulate strings

library(ggplot2) # create data visualizations like charts and maps
library(sf) # handle vector geospatial data
library(mapview) # create interactive maps

source(here('scripts/data_utils.R')) # custom functions for workshop
```

## Select City Nature Challenge observations

There are 191K City Nature Challenge observations for LA County. I need to select the observations that I want.

First I need to import the City Nature Challenge iNaturalist CSV into R. `read_csv()` reads the csv. `here()` helps deal with file paths. I pass in the file path of the CSV to `read_csv()`. I use assignment arrow `<-` to assign the content from `read_csv()` to an object called `inat_data`.

```{r read_inat_file}
inat_data <- read_csv(here('data/cleaned/cnc-los-angeles-observations.csv'))

```

`read_csv()` returns a dataframe. dataframe is how R represents tabular data with rows and columns. Double click on `inat_data` in Environment panel to see the data.

I use `names()` to see the column names in the dataframe. I will use the column names throughout the analysis.

```{r}
names(inat_data)
```

I use `filter()` to select which rows I want. `filter()` will return rows that match one or more criteria. Each criteria usually consists of column names and values we want to match.

I want observations for 'Great Blue Heron'. Since I want to use the Latin scientific names in my `filter()` query, I search iNaturalist for 'great blue heron', and go to its [taxa page](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/4956-Ardea-herodias) to get the scientific names. The kingdom is 'Animalia' and the species is 'Ardea herodias'.

Now that I have the scientific names, I can write my `filter()` query. I use `taxon_kingdom_name` and `taxon_species_name` instead of `scientific_name` because `taxon_kingdom_name` and `taxon_species_name` will find subspecies, while `scientific_name` will not.

I use `dim()` to display the number rows and columns.

```{r}
heron_obs <- inat_data %>%
  filter(taxon_kingdom_name == 'Animalia' &
         taxon_species_name == 'Ardea herodias')

dim(heron_obs)
```

There are 274 Great Blue Heron observations.

I also want to see how many observations are research grade. If there are a lot of "casual" or "need_id" observations, then I might also include them in my analysis.

I use `table()` to get the number of observations for each `quality_grade` value.

```{r}
table(heron_obs$quality_grade)
```

Since there are a lot of 'research' grade observations, I'm fine with limiting the observations to 'research' grade.

Since I want to look for observations in a certain area, I want to exclude observations that have obscured location. I use `table()` to get number of observations that have obscured locations.

```{r}
table(heron_obs$coordinates_obscured)
```

I add additional `filter()` commands for research grade and unobscured coordinates.

```{r}
heron_obs <- inat_data %>%
  filter(taxon_kingdom_name == 'Animalia' &
         taxon_species_name == 'Ardea herodias') %>%
  filter(quality_grade == 'research') %>%
  filter(coordinates_obscured == FALSE)


dim(heron_obs)
```

I have 266 research observations for Great Blue Heron with unobscured locations.

::: callout-note
There are lots of different ways that to filter the iNaturalist data. You need to decide what criteria you want to use to filter the iNaturalist data.
:::

We can use `unique()` to double check the all the `filter()` queries give us the results we expect.

```{r}
unique(heron_obs$taxon_kingdom_name)
unique(heron_obs$taxon_species_name)
unique(heron_obs$quality_grade)
unique(heron_obs$coordinates_obscured)
```

I save the heron observations as a CSV to the results folder using `write_csv()` and `here()`. I pass in the heron dataframe and the path to `write_csv()`. By default, `NA` values will be saved as 'NA'. I don't want 'NA' in the CSV, so I set `na=''`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_csv(heron_obs, here('results/heron_observations.csv'), na='')
```

## Create a map with CNC observations

Now that I have the observations I want, I can plot them on a map.

Since I want to create a map, I need to use `st_as_sf()` to convert the dataframe into a sf object. sf objects have a `geometry` column and other features that let us process geospatial data. I pass in "longitude" and "latitude" to `coords` so that `st_as_sf()` know which columns are the longitude and latitude columns. I set the CRS as 4326.

```{r}
heron_obs_sf <- heron_obs %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),   crs = 4326)
```

Now I can use `mapview()` to create an interactive map using the sf object `heron_obs_sf`. I use `mapview()` during the analysis because being able to zoom in and out makes it easier to explore the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_obs_sf)
```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_obs_map.png)

When I click on a blue circle on the map, a popup shows all 37 columns, which is too much information. I can use `select()` to limit the number of columns shown.

```{r}
heron_map <- heron_obs_sf %>%
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name, taxon_species_name, image_url)

dim(heron_map)
```

Then I create another map.

Now when I click on each blue circle, the popup shows 6 fields. The geometry column is shown in the popup even though I didn't put in `select()` because it is always included with sf objects.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_map)
```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_obs_map.png)

## Add bodies of water to the map

I want to study heron observations near water. First I need to load the file with the water areas. I use `read_sf()` to read geospatial files such as GeoJSON and Shapefiles. `read_sf()` returns a sf object with a `geometry` column.

```{r}
water_areas <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/la_county_waterareas.geojson'))
```

I can double click `water_areas` in the Environment panel to look at content. Each row in the table represents a body of water. Some records have names in `FULLNAME`, some do not.

When working with different geospatial data sets, we need the CRS to be the same so that everything lines up correctly. I use `st_crs()` to check the if the CRS of the heron observations is the same as the CRS of the water areas.

```{r}
st_crs(water_areas) == st_crs(heron_obs_sf)
```

Since the CRS are different, I need to use `st_transform()` to change CRS for the water areas so it is the same as heron observations. I pass in the `water_areas` sf object, and set the new CRS by passing the CRS of the heron observations to the `crs` argument.

Then I check if the CRS are equal.

```{r}
water_areas <- st_transform(water_areas,  crs = st_crs(heron_obs_sf))

st_crs(water_areas) == st_crs(heron_obs_sf)
```

Now that the CRS are the same, I can add the water areas and heron observations to the map. I have two sets of data: iNaturalist heron observations and water areas boundaries. I use a separate `mapview()` function for each data set. I set the color for the iNaturalist observations to green with `col.regions` to make them easier to see.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_map, col.regions='green') +
  mapview(water_areas)
```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_water_map.png)

::: callout-note
You can use `color()` to see a all the colors that R has available. You can use online tools to get [hex colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).
:::

## Observations near bodies of water

Bodies of water like rivers are kinda narrow and birds hangout in areas around water, so selecting observations that are inside river boundaries doesn't make sense. Instead, I want to get observations within 1/2 mile of a body of water. This means I need to create a buffer 1/2 mile for all bodies of water and find observations inside the buffers.

::: callout-note
Creating buffers is an optional step. If your analysis involves looking at the observations inside a region such as a park, neighborhood, county, etc, then you can skip the creating buffer.
:::

### create buffer

We used CRS 4326 for the iNaturalist observations. CRS 4326 uses angle degrees. To create a buffer for a certain distance, I need to change the CRS to a CRS that uses meters. CRS 5070 uses meters.

```{r}
water_areas_5070 <- st_transform(water_areas, crs=5070)
```

Then I use `st_buffer()` to create a buffer. 1/2 miles is about 805 meters. I pass in `water_areas_5070` and the size of the buffer.

```{r}
buffer_water_areas_5070 <- st_buffer(water_areas_5070, 805)
```

After creating the buffer, I need to change the CRS back to 4326.

```{r}
buffer_water_areas <- st_transform(buffer_water_areas_5070, crs=st_crs(heron_obs_sf))
```

Then I can create a map with the buffers.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_obs_sf, col.regions='green') +
  mapview(buffer_water_areas) +
  mapview(water_areas)
```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_buffer_water_map.png)

Looking at the map, I notice that most ‘Great Blue Heron’ observations are near bodies of water. I also notice that some of the smaller bodies of water aren’t included in ‘water_areas’.

### observations near water

Now that I have the buffers, I need to get observations inside the buffer.

`st_filter()` tells you if one geographic object is within or touching another geographic object.

The following code returns all heron observations that that is within or touching the water area buffers.

```{r}
heron_near_water_sf <-st_filter(heron_obs_sf, buffer_water_areas)

dim(heron_near_water_sf)
```

I have 240 observations near water.

Then I can create a map with the observations , buffers, and water areas.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_near_water_sf, col.regions='green') +
  mapview(buffer_water_areas)   +
  mapview(water_areas)

```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_near_water_buffer_water.map.png)

### observations near lakes in Whittier Narrows Recreation Area

While looking at the interactive maps, I noticed a cluster of heron observation for the three lakes in Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. I want to examine that area. I need to create `filter()` query to select the three lakes.

When you click on each body of water, a popup appears that show info about each body of water. Only one of the lakes have a `FULLNAME`, so I can't use `FULLNAME` to select the lakes. `HYDROID` is a unique ID for each body of water, so I can get the `HYDROID` from the popup, and create a `filter()` query to select the three lakes.

I create a vector with the `HYDROID`, and use `filter()` and `%in%` to find records that match the ids.

```{r}
ids <- c(1101584241267, 1101584241127, 1101584238995)

WNRA <- water_areas %>%
  filter(HYDROID %in% ids)
```

When I click on `WNRA` in the Environment panel, I see the three records.

I can create a buffer around the three lakes, and get the heron observations near the lakes.

```{r}
WNRA_5070 <- st_transform(WNRA, crs=5070)
buffer_WNRA_5070 <- st_buffer(WNRA_5070, 805)
buffer_WNRA <- st_transform(buffer_WNRA_5070, crs=st_crs(heron_obs_sf))

```

I use `st_filter` to get the observations within the buffer.

```{r}
heron_WNRA_sf <- st_filter(heron_obs_sf, buffer_WNRA)
  

dim(heron_WNRA_sf)
```

There are 15 observations in that area.

I then create a map for heron observations near the lakes in Whittier Narrows Recreation Area.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(heron_WNRA_sf, col.region='green') +
  mapview(WNRA)
  
```

![](images/mapview/example-analysis/heron_whittier.png)

::: callout-note
Anytime you have a file with lots of boundaries but you only want a few of the boundaries, use the `filter(column == value)` or `filter(column %in% c(values))` to get the boundaries for the regions you want. You can get the column names and values by looking at the spreadsheet-like viewer from RStudio or by looking at the popup table from mapview maps.
:::

## Create chart

I want to create a bar chart that shows the heron observations near water by year. I use `mutate` and `year()` to add a year column.

```{r}
heron_year <- heron_near_water_sf %>%
  mutate(year = year(observed_on))
```

I use `ggplot() + geom_bar()` to create a bar chart. I use the column `year` for the x axis, and `geom_bar()` will count the number of records and use the count for the y axis.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=heron_year, mapping=aes(x=year))
```

::: callout-note
To create line charts, you would use `geom_line().` You need to pass in a column for x axis and column for y axis when using `geom_line()` .
:::

Next I want to update the appearance of the chart. I use label function `labs()` to add titles, subtitle, and axis labels. I use `fill='#77b100'` to set the fill color to iNaturalist's green color. I use `theme_bw()` and `theme()` to change overall appearance of the chart. I use `scale_x_continuous(n.breaks=9)` to add labels for the 9 years along the x axis.

I assign the code for the chart to `heron_chart` object.

```{r}
heron_chart <- ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=heron_year, mapping=aes(x=year), fill='#77b100') +
  labs(title = 'CNC observations for Great Blue Herons in LA County',
       subtitle='2016-2024',
       x='Within 1/2 mile of water',
       y='observations count')  +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 14), 
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
   scale_x_continuous(n.breaks=9) 

heron_chart
```

::: callout-note
If you find that large chunk of code is too confusing, that's ok. You can just do a black and white chart.
:::

I use `ggsave()` to save charts created with ggplot. I pass in the file path and `heron_chart`. I save the image in the results folder. The file path ends with .jpg because I want a jpeg image. I also set the height and width for the image.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggsave(filename = here('results/heron_observations_near_water_chart.jpg'), 
       plot = heron_chart, height = 6, width = 8)
```

::: callout-note
You can also save the charts as PDF (.pdf), TIFF (.tiff), and PNG (.png)
:::

## Create map

I want to create a nice looking map for my presentation. ggplot offers more ways to customize the look of the map than mapview, so I use ggplot to create my final map.

One thing I want to add to the map is LA County boundary. I load the LA County file using `read_sf()`

```{r}
LA_county <- read_sf(here('data/cleaned/los_angeles_county/los_angeles_county.shp'))

```

I create a map with LA County boundaries, water areas, and heron observations using `ggplot() + geom_sf()`. Since there are three different sets of data, I add a separate `geom_sf()` for each sf object. I use `fill=` to color the LA County and water areas one color. I use `mapping=aes(color=near_water)` to color code the observations based on if they are near water.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=LA_county, fill='white') +
  geom_sf(data=heron_near_water_sf) +
  geom_sf(data=water_areas, fill='#007399')

```

I use `labs()` to add titles, subtitle, legend title. I use `theme_void()` and `theme()` to change overall appearance of the map.

I assign the code for the chart to `heron_final_map` object.

```{r}
heron_final_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=LA_county, fill='white') +
  geom_sf(data=heron_near_water_sf) +
  geom_sf(data=water_areas, fill='#007399') +
    labs(title = 'CNC observations for Great Blue Herons in LA County',
       subtitle='2016-2024',
       color='Within 1/2 mile of water') +
  theme_void() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 13))

heron_final_map
```

::: callout-note
If you find that large chunk of code, too confusing, that's ok. You can do a more simple map like the first example.
:::

I use `ggsave()` to save maps created with ggplot. The file path ends with .jpg because I want a jpeg image.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggsave(filename = here('results/heron_observations_near_water_map.jpg'), 
       plot = heron_final_map, height = 8, width = 8)
```

::: callout-note
You can also save the maps as PDF (.pdf), TIFF (.tiff), and PNG (.png)
:::

## Download iNaturalist images

I also want include some images of heron in my presentation.

I wrote some custom functions `download_inaturalist_images()` to download images from iNaturalist.

I use `filter()` to select observations that have 'CC0', 'CC-BY', or 'CC-BY-NC' license. Some iNaturalist observations do not have images. In order to select observations that have images, I use `!is.na(image_url)` . `!` means not; `is.na` checks if the value equals `NA`; `!is.na(image_url)` will select records where `image_url` is not NA. I use `slice_sample(n=3)` to get 3 random observations. Then I use `download_inaturalist_images()` to download images. The images are saved in 'results/images' folder.

```{r download_images}
#| eval: false

heron_images <- heron_near_water_sf %>%
  filter(license %in% c('CC0', 'CC-BY', 'CC-BY-NC')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(image_url)) %>%
  slice_sample(n=3)

download_inaturalist_images(heron_images)
```

## Download files from Codespace

I saved CSVs and images to Codespace. I then need to download the files to my computer.

Use the RStudio "Files" tab in the lower right corner. Click on the folders and green up arrow to navigate through the directories. Click the checkbox to select the files you want.

![](images/export-files/export-1.png)

Click "More" and a popup window will appear. Click "Export..."

![](images/export-files/export-2.png)

Click "Download" button on the popup window. The files will be saved to folder that your browser uses for the downloads.

![](images/export-files/export-3.png)

## Stop Codespace

After I finish my work for the day, I need to stop R, push my code changes to my repository and, stop Codespace.

To stop R, click the orange circle in the upper right of RStudio.

![](images/setup/stop_R.png)

I will see a message "R Session Ended". Close the browser tab for RStudio.

![](images/setup/r_session_ended.png)

Go to the Visual Studio Code browser tab. Click "bash". Click "TERMINAL".

![](images/setup/bash.png)

To save the changed files to my repository, type "bash scripts/save_files.sh" after the \$, and hit return/enter.

![](images/setup/bash_save_files.png)

To stop Codespace, click the blue area in the lower left corner of Visual Studio Code.

![](images/setup/stop_codespace_button.png)

A popup window will appear. Click "Stop Current Codespace".

![](images/setup/stop_codespace.png)

After a little while, I will see a "Codespace is stopped" message. I can now close the browser tab.

![](images/codespace-stop/Codespace-stopped.png){width="425"}

## Complete script

Here is all the code for the analysis. Some of the code is for checking results, such as `name()`, `dim()`, and `table()`. Some of the code such as 'observations near water, version 1' are things that I tried but end up not using because I tried something else.
