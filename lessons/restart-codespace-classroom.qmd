title: "Restart Codespace"

```{r}
#| include: false
classroom_organization <- 'data-explorers-feb-2025'
classroom_repos <- paste0('https://github.com/orgs/', classroom_organization, '/repositories')
```

1.  Go to [`{r} classroom_organization`](%60%7Br%7D%20classroom_repos%60) Github page, and you should see your repository. Click on your repository.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button. This will restart the Codespace created in the "Setup Github Classroom and Codespaces" section.

3.  This is Visual Studio Code, the default code editor for GitHub Codespaces. We want to use RStudio as our code editor.

    You will see page with "Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..." message in the corner. The software for the workshop is being downloaded and installed. This will take about 5 minutes.

4.  Once the Codespace has started, there should be a "bash", "Codespaces: timer", and "Codespaces: rstudio-start" on the lower right. Click on the "PORTS" tab at the bottom.

5.  In the PORTS tab, hover over the item named RStudio or 8787. Click on the middle globe icon to start RStudio in a new browser tab.

6.  Now you are ready to write and run R code using RStudio.

    Even though we won't use Visual Studio Code to write R code, keep the tab for Visual Studio Code open.
