For those who want to continue coding after the workshop, here some options

1.  Continue workshop projects.
2.  Create new projects on Github.
3.  Create new projects on your computer.

## 1. Continue workshop projects

Some attendees of the in-person workshop might want to continue working on their projects.

### Copy repository to your Github account

First step is to copy your repository from the workshop into your Github account. Go to your repository page on Github. There is a "Fork" button near the top. Creating a fork will copy the repo, and create a new repo in your Github account. Click the "Fork" button.

On the "Create a new fork" page, fill in the repository name, optionally add a description, and click "Create fork" button.

A copy of the repo will be added to your Github account.

### Start Codespace

Next step is to run Codespace on your repo in your Github account. Read the instructions on [Start Codespace](start-codespace.qmd).

## 2. Create new projects on Github

I created a template you can use to create new projects that runs R and Rstudio on Github Codespace. [R, RStudio, Codespace template](https://github.com/wykhuh/r-rstudio-codespace). You need to add your own R scripts and data.

## 3. Create new projects on your computer

If you want to run R code on your computer, you need to install RStudio, R, and R packages on your computer.

1.  Complete the steps for [Setup - local page \> "Install R and RStudio"](setup-local.qmd#install-r-and-rstudio)
2.  Complete steps for [Setup - local page \> "Install R packages"](setup-local.qmd#install-packages)
3.  Follow the instructions on [Setup - local page \> Organizing your project folder](setup-local.qmd#organizing-your-project-folder) to set up new projects.
