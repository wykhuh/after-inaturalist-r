title: "Coding after the workshop"
---

For those who want to continue coding after the workshop, here some options

1.  Continue workshop projects.
2.  Create new projects on Github.
3.  Create new projects on your computer.

## 1. Continue workshop projects

#### Copy repository to your Github account

First step is to copy your repository from the workshop into your Github account. Go to your repository page on Github. There is a "Fork" button near the top. Creating a fork will copy the repo, and create a new repo in your Github account. Click the "Fork" button.

Click "Create a new fork" in the popup.

On the "Create a new fork" page, fill in the repository name, optionally add a description, and click "Create fork" button.

A copy of the repo will be added to your Github account.

#### Start a Codespace

Next step is to run Codespace on your repo in your Github account.

Currently, every free Github account has access to 120 core hours per month to run Codespaces. When you start a Codespace, by default it uses 2 cores. This means you can run a Codespace for 60 hours per month (120 core hours / 2 cores = 60 hours). For more information, visit [Codespaces Billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).

1.  Click the green "Code" button near the top of the page.

2.  Click "Codespaces" tab.

3.  a\. If there are no Codespaces for the repo, click the green "Create codespace on main" button. The browser window loads the Codespace.

    b\. If a Codespace exists for the repo, you should see the randomly-assigned name for your previously-created Codespace. Click on the Codespace.

## 2. Create new projects on Github

I created a template you can use to create new projects that runs R and Rstudio on Github Codespace. [R, RStudio, Codespace template](https://github.com/wykhuh/r-rstudio-codespace). You need to add your own R scripts and data.

## 3. Create new projects on your computer

If you want to run R code on your computer, you need to install RStudio, R, and R packages on your computer.

1.  Complete the steps for [Setup - local page \> "Install R and RStudio"](setup-local.qmd#install-r-and-rstudio)
2.  Complete steps for [Setup - local page \> "Install R packages"](setup-local.qmd#install-packages)
3.  Follow the instructions on [Setup - local page \> Organizing your project folder](setup-local.qmd#organizing-your-project-folder) to set up new projects.
