You can use Github Codespace to run the code online without installing stuff on your computer.

## Create Github account

If you don't have a Github account, create an account.

1.  Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
2.  After you login, update your settings.
3.  Go to [Emails settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
    1.  Select 'Keep my email addresses private'. 'Block command line pushes that expose my email' should also be automatically selected.
4.  Optional. Go to [Password and authentication settings](https://github.com/settings/security).
    1.  If needed, setup Passkey or two-factor authentication.

## Start Codespace

1.  Go to [after_inaturalist_attendees](https://github.com/wykhuh/after_inaturalist_attendees) repository and click the "Use this template" green button, and select "Create an new repository". This will copy the workshop code to your Github account.

2.  On the "Create a new repository" page, fill in the Repository name. Choose if you want the repo public or private. Then click "Create repository" green button.

3.  You will be redirected to the new repository. Click the "Code" green button, and click "Create codespace on main" green button.

4.  This is Visual Studio Code, the default code editor for GitHub Codespaces. We want to use RStudio as our code editor.

    You will see page with "Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..." message in the corner. The software for the workshop is being downloaded and installed. This will take about 5 minutes.

5.  Once the Codespace has started, there should be a "bash", "Codespaces: timer", and "Codespaces: rstudio-start" on the lower right. Click on the "PORTS" tab at the bottom.

6.  In the PORTS tab, hover over the item named RStudio or 8787. Click on the middle globe icon to start RStudio in a new browser tab.

7.  Now you are ready to write and run R code using RStudio.

8.  The code for the workshop is in the "scripts" \> "lesson-scripts" folder. These are R scripts. Select a line of code, and run the code using <kbd>Cmd+Return</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> (Windows).

9.  You should read the lessons in the order from "Introduction to Data Analysis" to "Example Analysis". Skim the other lessons to see if they have examples relevant to your project. The R lesson script files starts with the [Working with data](working-with-data.qmd) lesson.

## Stop Codespace

After you finish your work for the day, you need to stop R, push your code changes to your repository and, stop Codespace. Read the instructions on the [Stop Codespace page](stop-codespace.qmd).

## Restart Codespace

After the initial setup of Codespace, you can restart an existing Codespace.

1.  Go to your repo.

2.  Click the green "Code" button. You should see the randomly-assigned name for your previously-created Codespace. Click on the Codespace.

3.  This is Visual Studio Code, the default code editor for GitHub Codespaces. You will see page with "Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..." message in the corner. This will take about 30 seconds.

    Follow steps 5 and after from "Start Codespace".
